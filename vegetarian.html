<h3 style="text-align:center;">What is it?</h3>
<p>
A vegetarian diet focuses on plants for food. These include fruits, vegetables, dried beans and peas, grains, seeds and nuts. There is no single type of vegetarian diet. Instead, vegetarian eating patterns usually fall into three groups :
<li>The vegan diet</li>
<li>The lacto vegetarian diet</li>
<li>The lacto-ovo vegetarian diet</li>
</ul>
People who follow vegetarian diets can get all the nutrients they need. However, they must be careful to eat a wide variety of foods to meet their nutritional needs. Nutrients vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc and vitamin B12.

Many people stop eating meat for ideological, ethical, or religious reasons. But often, the focus is on health. Here are some ways in which avoiding meat products can enhance a person's health.
