<h3 style="text-align:center;">What is it?</h3>
<p>
The Zone diet aims for a nutritional balance of 40 percent carbohydrates, 30 percent fats, and 30 percent protein in each meal. The focus is also on controlling insulin levels, which may result in more successful weight loss and body weight control than other approaches. The Zone diet encourages the consumption of high-quality carbohydrates - unrefined carbohydrates, and fats, such as olive oil, avocado, and nuts.
</p>
<p>The Zone diet has four "pillars," or aims that a person has to bring together to make it part of their way of life. They are to:
<ul>
<li>restrict calories without hunger or fatigue</li>
<li>maintain appropriate levels of inflammation in the body</li>
<li>use dietary polyphenols to activate genes for improved wellness</li>
<li>control the inflammation caused by gut microbes</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="text-align:center;color:white">Basic rules</h3>
<p>The Zone diet was designed to reduce so-called dietary inflammation. The development of many conditions and diseases involves inflammation. These range in severity from mild gastrointestinal or digestive issues, to playing a role in the onset of cancers and other serious illnesses.
The Zone diet involves some basic rules:
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">	
<li> A meal or snack should be eaten no later than 1 hour after waking up in the morning. </li>
<li>The interval between meals should be 4-6 hours.  </li>
<li>A meal should be eaten between 2-2.5 hours after a snack, whether the person is hungry or not.  </li>
<li>The individual should drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day.
The meal or snack should start with a low-fat protein. Then the person can add good carbohydrates with a low glycemic index, such as vegetables and fruits, and good fats, such as olive oil or avocado.
</li>
<p>Typical meal protein should be about 4 ounces for men and 3 ounces for women.</p>
<p>Before every meal or snack, a person should assess their hunger level. If they are not hungry and their mind is clear, they are in "The Zone.‚Äù</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center;color:white">Meal plans</h3>
<p>
Three meals and two snacks should be included every day. Each meal and snack should contain some protein. The more carbohydrates people consume, the more insulin they secrete. Insulin turns excess carbohydrates into stored fat. Dietary fat does not trigger insulin secretion. As a result, Zone diet meal plans focus on eating:
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>low-density carbohydrates</li>
<li>dietary fat</li>
<li>protein</li>
</ul>
People who follow the diet should balance carbohydrates, fats, and proteins in the following proportions:
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>40 percent carbohydrate</li>
<li>30 percent fat</li>
<li>30 percent protein</li>
</ul>
