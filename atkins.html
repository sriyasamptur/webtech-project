  <h3 style="text-align:center;">What is it?</h3>
  <p>The Atkins diet, or Atkins nutritional approach, focuses on controlling the levels of insulin in the body through a low-carbohydrate diet.
If people consume large amounts of refined carbohydrates, their insulin levels rise and fall rapidly. Rising insulin levels trigger the body to store energy from the food that is consumed, making it less likely that the body will use stored fat as a source of energy.
Therefore, people on the Atkins diet avoid carbohydrates but can eat as much protein and fat as they like.</p>
<p>The Atkins Diet has four core principles. These state that the dieter will:
<ul>
  <li>lose weight</li>
  <li>maintain weight loss</li>
  <li>achieve good health</li>
    <li>lay the permanent groundwork for disease prevention</li>
</ul>

  <h3 style="text-align:center;color:white">The Atkins diet is split into 4 different phases:</h3>
    <p>
<b style="font-size:120%;">Phase 1 - Induction :</b>
Calorie consumption from carbohydrates is limited to less than 20 grams (g) each day for two weeks. Carbohydrates come mainly from salad and vegetables, which are low in starch. Eat high-fat, high-protein food with low-carbohydrate vegetables, such as leafy greens.</p>
<p>
<b style="font-size:120%;">Phase 2 - Balancing:</b>
Nutrient-dense and fibre rich foods are added as additional sources of carbohydrates. These include nuts, low-carb vegetables and small amounts of fruit.</p>
<p>
<b style="font-size:120%;">Phase 3 - Fine-tuning, or pre-maintenance:</b>
Increase the carbohydrate intake by 10 g each week until you begin to lose weight very slowly.</p>
<p>
<b style="font-size:120%;">Phase 4 - Lifetime maintenance:</b>
You can start adding a wider range of carbohydrate sources, while carefully monitoring your weight to ensure it does not go up.
