<p>Although needed only in small amounts, micro-nutrients are essential for the proper functioning of every system in the body and are vital for good health. There are two classes of micronutrients, vitamins and minerals. Each vitamin and mineral has a specific role in bodily function.

Our bodies cannot make all of these micro-nutrients, so they must be supplied through the diet. Different foods contain different levels of vitamins and minerals, so it's important that you eat a wide variety of foods from the different food groups and a variety within each food group, to make sure you get an adequate supply of all the micro-nutrients your body needs.

Vitamin A is an important micronutrient needed for healthy eyesight and gums, Vitamin C for a healthy functioning immune system, and Vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant which helps fight free radical damage in the body. We need vitamin D for strong bones and immune function, and our B vitamins for energy production, nervous system health and for proper digestion.

There are also essential minerals that play important roles in the body such as iron needed for red blood cell production, calcium for strong healthy bones and teeth, magnesium for nervous system health, and zinc for healthy skin, reproductive and immune function. Selenium is also an important mineral which acts as an antioxidant to protect the body from chronic diseases and premature aging.
