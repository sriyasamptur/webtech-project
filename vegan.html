<h3 style="text-align:center;">What is it?</h3>
<p>
Vegans do not eat animal products, including honey, eggs, gelatin, or dairy. They do not use clothes, soaps, or other products that are animal-sourced in any way. A vegan diet can be a highly nutritious choice, as it is low in saturated fat and rich in nutrients.
All protein, vitamins, and minerals must come from non-animal sources, so food choice and preparation are important. Supplements are recommended to replace levels of certain nutrients that are found in meat, such as vitamin B-12.
Animal products are important sources of protein, non-saturated fats, iron, vitamins, and minerals in the standard diet of a person. A vegan needs to find alternative sources of these nutrients.

<h3 style="text-align:center;color:white">Considerations</h3>
<p>An entirely plant-based diet has low health risks, but careful planning is needed to maintain nutritional balance. Vegans may be more prone to shortages of vital nutrients. The following nutrients are likely to be in short supply in a vegan diet, but alternatives are available. Impact of the following dietary changes:</p>
<ul>	
<li> <b style="font-size:120%;">Vitamin B-12:</b>
This is needed to protect nerves and red blood cells, and certain types are only available in animal produce. B-12-fortified plant foods, such as fortified soy, seaweed, cereals, and nutritional yeast can replace lost intake.  </li>

<li> <b style="font-size:120%;">Iron:</b>
This is an important nutrient for absorbing oxygen into the blood and transporting it to the cells in the body. Dried beans and dark leafy greens may be better sources of iron than meat on a per-calorie basis. </li>

<li> <b style="font-size:120%;">Calories:</b>
A vegan diet can reduce the intake of calories. While too many calories can lead to weight gain and associated health problems, too few can lead to problems with low weight. Supplement calories should be taken.</li>

<li> <b style="font-size:120%;">Calcium:</b>
This is crucial for bone health and development. Eat more tofu, tahini, and green, leafy vegetables to top up calcium levels. </li>

<li> <b style="font-size:120%;">Vitamin D:</b>
This protects against multiple cancers and chronic diseases, and helps to strengthen the bones and teeth. Regularly consuming more vitamin-D-fortified foods and spending time in the sun can boost vitamin D levels.</li>

<li> <b style="font-size:120%;">Omega-3 fatty acids such as DHA and ALA: </b>
Omega-3 fatty acids, such as fish oil, are vital for a healthy heart, eye function, and brain function. While EPA, another type of omega-3, cannot be obtained with a vegan diet, ALA and DHA can be found in ground flaxseed, walnuts, canola oil, soy products, and hemp beverages. </li>
<li> <b style="font-size:120%;">Zinc:</b>
Deficiency can lead to hair loss, poor healing of wounds, immunological problems, and dermatitis. Whole grains, legumes, and soy products are rich in zinc. </li>
